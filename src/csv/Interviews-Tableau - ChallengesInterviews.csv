4,14,"Mean, captive of their platform and you also have to sign with your blood and agreements that you're doing it for academic purposes and those kind of things, because IBM can be quite aggressive with their partnership, um, policies. So except that I had to sign something that was a little bit too much from my perspective, this kind of tooling was good.",Cloud providers can have aggressive policies in the agreements for academic purposes.
6,1,There is no accepted taxonomy of what the concepts of DevOps are.,There is no taxonomy about what are the main DevOps concepts.

[...] the challenge there is I had to put together a curriculum that had, um, a little bit about everything. [...] So it's challenging fitting all that stuff into one semester.

   There's lots and lots of information, which is why I give them lots of support during the week on slack. Um, but there's lots of information to cover. And because it's so challenging, I don't get to cover a lot of once you deploy it, how do you monitor it? Uh, right. And, and, and how do you, how do you, you know, go through the logs? And I mean, we do a little bit of looking at the logs when we deploy it to figure out if it's working, but I don't do a lot of the ops side of DevOps.","DevOps has too much contents and it's hard to fit it in a semester.

No time to teach operations side."
8,9,"And in terms of operation, a lot of the stuff that we tend to do at university tends to be fairly small because there's just realistic time constraints for how much people can get done in a week or two, or even in a term or a semester. ...  that I've found is a little bit of misconception or at least prejudice around what devops actually is.

Because in though in the ops part, and this is the stuff I typically don't have as much time for simply because I know most of the students are coming from the software development side of the house.","Realistic time constraints prejudice around what devops actually is.

9,10,"You have the machines where you deploy to. Um, and quite often the students are in the same classroom on the wifi of the universities or the under the sub network, but the ports are not open [...] you need a lot of machines interconnected, um, with visibility on each other that they can get to. And that's hard in a, in a, in a classroom environment this year I had 78 students.

All of those challenges are basically how do you rebuild an enterprise environment into a university environment that is much more restrictive and doesn't have enough machines for them. Usually that's a real challenge.","The academy has network limitations to create near-real infrastructure.

A partner editor, including the board, who brought a catalog of books for us to take a look at, and I went after it, including a book on the subject, right? From corporate systems, right, from this part of DevOps, and simply, I didn't find it in the catalog.

The even greater difficulty, which I can point out, is precisely the structuring, really, perhaps of the sequence of classes, because we do not have this material that guides.","Difficulty finding book on corporate systems related to DevOps.

Literature in the area of ​​enterprise systems related to DevOps is insufficient.

Difficulty in structuring classes due to lack of reference material."
12,5,"It is a discipline with no definition, so there is no introductory textbook. There is not something totally agreed upon between the community of what it is, when it is applied, and such.

There are not so many scientific articles on which to base course preparation."
12,11," And then the books are more industry oriented. Like, uh, we don't look at the, uh, uh, more with teaching parts, like, um, so there is no textbook, actually it is more industry document, eh, discussion about DevOps.

 what we sit and do, but, uh, so from the lab perspective, that's interesting, but on the teaching side, as I said, like, uh, having limited material, make the teaching a little bit more difficult.

your books are written mostly with the different projects in mind. Like they are thinking about people working in the company, but not thinking about students who are learning. And this makes it very difficult to design a DevOps curriculum where you cover a hundred percent DevOps in one course.","The books are more industry oriented. There is no textbook about with discussion about DevOps concepts.

There's limited material to teach.

Books are designed to company professionals and not about to students who are learning."
13,2,"Once it's deployed, how do you manage to monitor and give and maybe get feedback from the customer, maybe things to improve, the monitoring of the system itself, this part is a challenge, really, to be able to show it to the student and maybe , make him face it from a more professional perspective, because already imagining that he is going to the market and will come across these many situations there.

When they arrive, many use another environment[...] they put the system there and they don't have to worry too much about other details[...] We really ask them to make this migration for them to have this other view, this aspect of setting up the environment. Putting it into production and keeping this system working.[...] I think this can be seen as a challenge, which is to convince students to give importance to this, the importance of them knowing these aspects too, not leaving it so transparent to them too.","It is difficult to make the student face teaching scenarios with a more professional perspective, with production-level monitoring.

Difficulty in making clear to students the importance of having a more realistic perspective of production, using other environments and leaving aside the comfort zone in which they may be inserted."
14,2,"The challenge of making students see this approach to operationalization, putting the system on the air, maintaining this system, adding new features and not breaking the system.

The concept of continuous delivery [...] The difficult thing is to put it into practice [...] when they, as a team, need to release a certain functionality and ensure that it doesn't break the system.","Difficulty in teaching the student how to operate the system, allowing the addition of new features without breaking the system.

Many DevOps tools and usability available."
22,5,"A difficulty of technologies is about recognizing what is relevant to be addressed in the classroom, is not it? So, for example, there is much technology on the market.","Difficulty in deciding which technologies to teach, given the wide variety available on the market."
22,6,"Because the DevOps universe has millions of tools, technologies, and [...] It has an infinity of tools, they all meet the objectives. They are good and such.",There are many DevOps tools.
22,7,"This is a problem because of what happens: there are several tools, and we always have to close on some for the didactic nature of experimentation.",There are many DevOps tools to choose from.
22,8,"The other big challenge is: technology. People come with Macs, people come with windows, people come with Linux. [...] So that's the other challenge is people coming in with different technology and then how do you teach them the same thing without saying: ""oh, the command in windows is this and the command on a Mac is that.""",It's hard to deal with many options of tools.
22,11,"It can be also challenging for the, if you have the lab instructor with handling all tools.",The lab instructor should handle many tools.
25,3,The main challenge is to correctly convey to students the idea that DevOps is about a culture.,Difficulty to teach the DevOps culture.
25,4,It is the cultural challenge of I am not going to deliver a ready-made recipe.,There is no ready-made recipe to teach the DevOps mindset (culture).
25,6,"How to apply these things from Devops in companies [...] there is a great difficulty that is cultural. Companies have always organized themselves in this way, separating movement from infrastructure, not having collaboration, not having communication, and this ends up generating friction, especially when problems arise [...] go on changing a little the company's culture, the process, the way people organize themselves, meet, and such, trying to remove the barriers there until it is natural and both teams work together [...] with a single goal, which is to develop, deliver software that works and solve problems as quickly as possible.

Trying to contextualize this too is very difficult.","Difficulty breaking through resistance to the DevOps culture and its principles.

Difficulty contextualizing the DevOps culture."
25,8,Culture is difficult to teach.,Culture is difficult to teach.
26,3,"The student hopes to [...] learn that killer tool, which will help in the practical context of his life, whether in the process of development, security or operations. [...] wants to know the tools much more than understand the DevOps culture.","Students have a prior concept that DevOps is restricted to the use of tools, not being interested in the cultural part of DevOps."
26,4,"The first challenge is to decouple the idea that about DevOps [...] to deliver a formula.

The students arrive with the idea that they have a set of X tools to deliver in their daily lives and tools only a piece and a small piece within the delivery process, which is more cultural and more personal than tooling, huh? Organizational even, I would say.

It is to set expectations when he signs up that the entire course is not tooling and that no, we will not use the best stacks in the market.","Difficulty explaining to students that DevOps is not just about tools.

Difficulty in explaining to students that DevOps is not just tooling, it encompasses the cultural part.

Difficulty adjusting students' expectations, as most of them just want to use new tools."
26,6,"Give this view that DevOps is not just a tool [...] It is very much in line with agile movement.

Trying to show that DevOps is not just tools, trying to make people understand this and trying to change it during the class, so trying as best as possible to make people understand, right? That they will end up having to change the culture of the environment, right? The processes, the way they organize themselves.","Difficulty in being able to explain to the student that DevOps does not involve only the tooling part.

Difficulty breaking the student perspective that DevOps is just tools and automation."
26,9," People coming through the programs want to play with technology. ... But what that tends to foster is a technology centric attitude about what devops is all about. ... That's half the reason we got into this field in the first place, and it's a really fun thing to be able to do, but it's not sufficient.",Students came to course focused in the tools.
26,11,There's a big focus on tools.,So many people only focus on the tools side from DevOps.
26,12,DevOps doesn't equal CI/CD and DevOps doesn't equal automate the testing.,DevOps is not only CI/CD and automation.
26,14,Let's say political challenge that you have to convince in a way that DevOps is not purely technical and that it's must be part of an academy curriculum.,Convince people that DevOps is not purely technical and it must be part of an academy curriculum.
28,3,"[...] in many cases the assessment is still based on the traditional test model or on some fixed assessment process, with an X list of questions or something similar.",Difficulty dealing with assessments based on a traditional test model.
29,3,"The DevOps concept, it's very open, right, it encompasses different areas between development, security and operations.","The teaching of devops is multidisciplinary, covering different areas such as development, safety and operation."
29,7,"You cannot teach DevOps without experiencing DevOps, right? You cannot read in a book and want to teach DevOps because DevOps is a very practical discipline. There is a lot that happens in practice. So, there is a lot of doubt, from concepts, about Kubernetes configuration error, for example. So, these are things that we have to deal with [...] So, venturing out to teach DevOps, parachuting, that is a big challenge because the level of knowledge you will have to collect for this is quite diverse and multidisciplinary.",There is a very diverse and multidisciplinary knowledge in teaching DevOps.
30,3,"If the student is in a context where he has always been in the academic area or he has never had practical contact with any of these features of software development, it is likely that it will be much more challenging for him.

If the student is in a context where he has always been in the academic area, or he has never had practical contact with any of these features of software development, [...] for the teacher, it becomes much more challenging to teach the DevOps concept this student profile.","There is a greater difficulty in understanding devops by students whose background is more academic, who have no experience in software development or direct operation.

It is difficult to teach students with more academic training that have no experience in software development or operation directly."
30,12,"The main challenge remain the able to, to, to teach the fundamentals. I think that this type, of course almost requires some type of industrial experience, because if you've not been in contact with the industry, there are so many things that are, um, more difficult to, to, to eally understand.

Teaching this course, it's possible to teach it with students with no experience, but it makes the thing like this. I've been trying to have interactions with the students about, I know certain topics become quite difficult because they cannot relate it to anything concrete.","It is difficult to teach DevOps concepts without industry experience.

It is difficult to teach students with no industrial experience."
30,13,"It didn't work for some specific tools that they wanted to present using this a katacoda, uh, website.",The students don't have the proper background to listen the lecture of people from the industry.
30,14,"I mean, there are students, so they are, they are not in the industry yet. And so that's, that would be the main part to make the student understand that it's, it's not about configuring Jenkins or having Docker running on their computer.

When you're talking to freshmen and they have no idea what's happening. Like they have a superficial idea of what's happening. Then it's like finding a way to explain them why the mindset is important.","The students without industry experience can have difficulty to understand that DevOps is much more than using tools.

It is difficult to explain the importance of DevOps mindset to students that have a superficial idea of what is happening to industry."
31,3,"DevSecOps [...] is the type of discipline that requires strong knowledge in two areas, both distinct, in the security area, but at the same time in the development area to be able to find the link between the two and then yes, get to what the student.",The teacher needs good technical knowledge in the areas of security (especially vulnerability management) and systems development to teach DevSecOps.
31,14,The second point that the second challenge would be [...] skills.  I'm working on software engineering and I'm working on how to build software since the gate.,Skills to teach DevOps are challeging.
32,4,"The second challenge is people with different experiences [...] you have mixed classes, so at a point in the course where you talk about a specific programming language to give an example. Some are more familiar than others. [...] So, knowing how to deal with these differences to make the course pleasant for everyone and comfortable for everyone, this is a great challenge.

We have a standard agreement, not an agreement. It is a convention that we have which is the following, people are different, see? [...] they have different backgrounds, they have different life stories, experiences that marked them in different ways.","Difficulty in knowing how to deal with groups of students who have very different experiences.

Students in a class have different backgrounds, life stories and experiences."
32,5,"In both classes that I taught [...], there was a challenge of class heterogeneity.

People who came from operational, System admin itself is not so proficient in the programming part, in code.",Difficulty in preparing classes with students at different levels of proficiency in development and operation.
32,6,"Each student in the class brings a different experience, different challenges, and trying to generalize this is more complicated.",Dealing with the different experiences and perspectives of each student.
32,8,"One of the challenges is how do you teach people from these different backgrounds [...]  there is so much technology that comes together in DevOps, that the challenge is how do you get everyone up to speed on an even right? So that we can all move forward together and learn together. So, so that's a big challenge.",It's hard to teach people with different backgrounds.
32,10,"Some of them do have a lot of programming and are fairly mature, but because when we recruit, they be coming from different schools.",Students have different backgrouds.
27,4,"As people are remote, basically for training, there are several factors that influence the didactics. The home environment, even, that the person, sometimes, does not live alone, or has sons, daughters. This is not a problem for people, for me, a teacher, as a teacher, but for a person, sometimes, you can't open a camera. You can't do one, so dealing with these differences within the pandemic is important. It's not a problem, but it's a point of e also the differences from the infrastructure that the person has to take the course. A machine a little newer, older, pre-configured for work, there are companies that already have the machine ready for day to day and the course uses other configurations which are challenges that we have with the students to talk, look, I need version X, and the person does not have the installation permission.
","Difficulties in remote work with students: privacy, availability, infrastructure differences, environment configuration."
33,6,"Another challenge too, that [...] we changed our model from in-person to online, live. And then, we had this problem, right, that in the course there is a project, with certain technologies, but, in our case, we already have a laboratory that has everything installed and configured. So, in this case, man, now, it's the student who's going to do his homework, right, how is he going to configure the infrastructure with that specific project and without having a headache, it won't interfere in class.",Students find it difficult to configure the tools on their own machines in remote teaching mode.
35,2,"The DevOps concept, it's very open, right, it encompasses different areas between development, security and operations.",Difficulty in making the association between theory and practice.
35,4,"The expectation of students to deliver something, by hand, because they are technical people, is to be able to balance what is concept and what is practical and show the importance, the value of what you are explaining.",Difficulty balancing theory foundations and make them interesting in the practice.
35,6,"This part of culture and such, which is, let us say, more boring, right? That people go there wanting to see tools, right? So, how to balance, right? Talk a little non-technical things with technical things.

The challenge is this: having the non-technical part with the technical part, pondering both, and addressing these main topics, right?","Difficulty in balancing the teaching of theory (culture) and practice (tools).

Challenge to balance theory and practice."
35,11,"The point is how do we adapt DevOps in concept in a way where we, we are still take keeping in mind the theoretical foundation, but where make it making it interesting from an industry or practical perspective.",It's challenging to teach DevOps concepts that have theoretical foundations and make them interesting from the industry perspective.
35,12,"The challenge is, in my opinion, is, is to, to strike this balance between, between, um, concreteness, like work with technologies, because essentially, uh, DevOps is yes, a philosophy. 

To strike a balance. The students are of course, very keen about the products and telemetry about the product and, and, and, and building Docker containers. And, but what I want them to reflect, I mean, the whole goal of DevOps is to make the process effective, very, very efficient.","It is difficult to balance the concreteness (technologies) and the philosophy (concepts) of DevOps.

It is difficult to balance the usage of tools and making the DevOps process effective and efficient."
35,14,"There's a gap between what we can experiment during the course, what can be presented during the invited lecture from the industry, for example, those kinds of things and how, how whole, the things are connected together.",There is a gap about how to connect the lectures with the labs.
36,4,"For you to be able to look at all the students is very difficult, I understand why some cannot open the camera. It does not have the capacity or technology or structure to open, talk to you. Communication is broken, no matter how much we open it all the time, even if Zoom allows it. It is different from everyday life in the classroom because you cannot look at the student and see how he is reacting to that content. Not that you only adapt to one student, but you do not have the personal perception of doubt. Sometimes you can look at the student and say, oh, I think that was not clear to him. It is a challenge.",Difficulty in monitoring and keeping in touch with all students effectively during remote learning classes.
36,8,"Because of the remote learning [...] I've been teaching my classes on zoom. And so, uh, that makes it very hard to do hands-on because I can't see the students right. While I'm doing the hands-on. So I can't see the puzzled look on their face and say, okay, I just lost them.",It's hard to do hands-on on remote learning because the teacher can't see the students face.
36,12,"To make the lecture attractive students have to willing to interact. Right. Which is very difficult to do. And of course, uh, zoom teaching, uh, makes it a challenge.",It is very difficult to interact with students in lecture remote teaching.
37,5,"There's still this challenge of understanding these tools, environment, network, configuration, you know? So, I think one challenge brings the other, right? I would say this is a challenge, too.","Difficulty in understanding environment, tools and network configuration."
38,5,"When you go to configure the tools and such, as you were the one who developed the system, it becomes easier, I believe you understand all the automations and such, but at the same time I see that the guys have a lot of difficulty in doing it.",There is difficulty for students to carry out the automation of the construction of systems used during the course.
39,5,"This part of the system, which I ask them to do to monitor the discipline, [...] ok, I'll give you a system, will it be an open source system? Me too, you know? Since I can give you a system, let's use a real system that isn't a joke. So, like, I think of a great open souce system there, that has testing, has a shitload of stuff, has continuous integration and has I don't know what, and you can select the test battery that will be used in each corner, You know?",Difficulty selecting an example system realistic enough for students to use during the course.
39,9,You have to make a business case. It's a lot harder to do.,It is hard to do a business case to demonstrate the importance of running devops.
39,11,"The challenge sometimes is finding a good open source application, which is not too big also because you don't want the project to be too big. You don't want it to be too small, but you don't want too big. So, so finding something in between, which can be used. And, and, uh, so.

The challenge for us is getting an application, which is interesting [...] you know, like they can use.","It is difficult to find the right sized open source project to use. It is should be not too small and not too bit.

It is difficult to find an interesting sample application that students use."

41,8,"You have to change the tools almost every semester or every two years. You've got to look at what are the popular tools right now.

So the challenge for me is that the cloud is constantly evolving. And so every semester what I try to do in my class, in my labs, I have snapshots of screenshots and circles and arrows and, you know, click on this and move there. Um, and that changes constantly.

So there's a lot of preparation in making sure that the tools still work the way they should, that the cloud still works the way they should, um, that the code doesn't have vulnerabilities in it. And that you've got all the right versions of stuff. So that's a lot of, uh, preparation then of course, as I said, you know, new technologies, like when Kubernetes came around, you know, you have to add Kubernetes to the class, constantly adding new technologies to the class move.

We move through some technology on the application side, we'll move through a little bit of technology on the operation side. What does change is trying to keep up to speed and keep the class adjusted for, uh, what the current state of the art and the current understanding of best practices.

There's always double checking the technology, making sure that if you've got any automation in your class, it still works after all of the API changes may have gone into effect on say your cloud provider or, or whatever, making sure you're on the latest and greatest versions of whatever tooling that you're going to use and make sure that the hat that hasn't broken things and always missing something and suddenly be scrambling before class going, oh no, no, no.

And then the second day it doesn't work because there's an upgrade in the Docker API that makes things totally different. Or you you're, you're using it in the Dockerfile, you're using keywords. And then suddenly the new version of Docker decide that those keywords are deprecated and that you should not, uh, declared the authors this way.

So keeping things up to date and making things work like really working in, in, in being able to run the labs, not in panic mode, that everything was fragile and everything was able to collapse at any point was really stressful.
