2,"To configure a environment needed to start.

I had difficulty setting up the infrastructure.

If you want a kind of hybrid discipline, in which you have the theory and applied practice, then the challenge will be different, then it ranges from having an environment for it to structuring the environment, or thinking about something like that, to making a virtual machine available.

We've tried to let the students, uh, deal with the setup and, uh, install everything on their computer with Dockerizing stuff and scan things. And that was yet another disaster because then it's not reproducible and it works on their computer, but then it's really complicated to make it work on the TA.","Difficulty configuring and setting up the infrastructure needed to run DevOps experiments.

Student machine capacity restriction.

We depend on the internet, I will give you a straightforward example, you will use the virtual machine, no matter how much you use Vagrant, for example, it needs to download a base image. And depending on the student's location, it takes two minutes and up to two hours.

Neither a local datacenter nor one of these commercials, many times it is not, it does not have all the possibilities you could use, at least not, without being linked to an agreement or something like that.

If you are going to make this CI in the cloud commercially, you will have to pay. It is not free. Free here just for us to play, right? However, if you want to put your company's system to do, I don't know how many integrations per week, you will have to pay for it.

8,"We sometimes want to teach everything and we don't have infinite time[...] to fit the knowledge of DevOps, which is very broad knowledge and involves at least two distinct areas[...]

Making it fit was more difficult because sometimes the content is too long and time is limited.

The challenge in this aspect refers to [..] the issue of laboratories [...], but you always end up as a matter of time versus class development.

When I taught the DevOps course in my master's, it was DevOps from beginning to end, right? So I had to decide everything that was going to go into the content. There is a lot that was left out.

This area of ​​DevOps is gigantic too. So training is limited there. It is a forty-hour training, right?

My biggest challenge is that my course should be two semesters because it's just too much stuff to fit in one semester. [...] the challenge there is I had to put together a curriculum that had, um, a little bit about everything. [...] So it's challenging fitting all that stuff into one semester.

   There's lots and lots of information, which is why I give them lots of support during the week on slack. Um, but there's lots of information to cover. And because it's so challenging, I don't get to cover a lot of once you deploy it, how do you monitor it? Uh, right. And, and, and how do you, how do you, you know, go through the logs? And I mean, we do a little bit of looking at the logs when we deploy it to figure out if it's working, but I don't do a lot of the ops side of DevOps.

And in terms of operation, a lot of the stuff that we tend to do at university tends to be fairly small because there's just realistic time constraints for how much people can get done in a week or two, or even in a term or a semester. ...  that I've found is a little bit of misconception or at least prejudice around what devops actually is.

Because in though in the ops part, and this is the stuff I typically don't have as much time for simply because I know most of the students are coming from the software development side of the house.

That's exactly. That's a lot for one semester.

The main challenge is that, in general, DevOps related tools are cloud-based systems.

In general, you have a wide range of solutions. You have a very large ecosystem of possibilities on how to test or demonstrate a concept.

A difficulty of technologies is about recognizing what is relevant to be addressed in the classroom, is not it? So, for example, there is much technology on the market.

Because the DevOps universe has millions of tools, technologies, and [...] It has an infinity of tools, they all meet the objectives. They are good and such.

This is a problem because of what happens: there are several tools, and we always have to close on some for the didactic nature of experimentation.

Because the DevOps universe has millions of tools, technologies, and [...] It has an infinity of tools, they all meet the objectives. They are good and such.

41,"If I make this system [...] We, professors, sometimes are not the most proficient programmers there are, so maybe what we write is not in accordance with what is happening in the market today.

So it is in line with what is happening in the community as a whole, right? Always trying to bring it, because this area, specifically, it runs very fast. So, every semester I run this discipline once a year, there are very strong updates on what is happening.

You have to change the tools almost every semester or every two years. You've got to look at what are the popular tools right now.

So the challenge for me is that the cloud is constantly evolving. And so every semester what I try to do in my class, in my labs, I have snapshots of screenshots and circles and arrows and, you know, click on this and move there. Um, and that changes constantly.

So there's a lot of preparation in making sure that the tools still work the way they should, that the cloud still works the way they should, um, that the code doesn't have vulnerabilities in it. And that you've got all the right versions of stuff. So that's a lot of, uh, preparation then of course, as I said, you know, new technologies, like when Kubernetes came around, you know, you have to add Kubernetes to the class, constantly adding new technologies to the class move.

The big challenge for me right, is, uh, is keeping up with the technology [...] so it's just challenging to keep up with all the new technology that's out there in DevOps.

And so every so often I'll get folks who have taken one class and then they start using the wrong version of the tool for the second class, because they have an upgraded or something along those lines. 

We move through some technology on the application side, we'll move through a little bit of technology on the operation side. What does change is trying to keep up to speed and keep the class adjusted for, uh, what the current state of the art and the current understanding of best practices.

There's always double checking the technology, making sure that if you've got any automation in your class, it still works after all of the API changes may have gone into effect on say your cloud provider or, or whatever, making sure you're on the latest and greatest versions of whatever tooling that you're going to use and make sure that the hat that hasn't broken things and always missing something and suddenly be scrambling before class going, oh no, no, no. They've changed something. I need to figure this out.

Um, we got bit by that quite a few times where we built the stack plus G unit plus, uh, we use, um, uh, some additional libraries for front-end, uh, some scripts for building Docker images, some version of Maven, and you need an Artifactory, et cetera. You can get everything set up, everything works fine up to June. Then you go on summer break and then the next session comes up in September and you use what you've built well, too bad. In the middle of the summer, Jay, you need to release a new version that requires where some acts of Maven that requires this version of the stack of the student install from scratch on their machine.

The main, uh, challenge that we had was that DevOps is, there are many too many tools and, uh, many of these tools are not solid and are not commonly used yet.

 I mean devops is always evolving and we are not what we consider DevOps here is different for, from what was considered DevOps, let's say five years ago.

The lab session, they have to be like really precise. You have to, it would work one day. And then the second day it doesn't work because there's an upgrade in the Docker API that makes things totally different. Or you you're, you're using it in the Dockerfile, you're using keywords. And then suddenly the new version of Docker decide that those keywords are deprecated and that you should not, uh, declared the authors this way.

So keeping things up to date and making things work like really working in, in, in being able to run the labs, not in panic mode, that everything was fragile and everything was able to collapse at any point was really stressful. And of course, a lot of things, I think it costs me like twice or three times the cost of preparing a regular course.","Difficulty for teachers to keep up with the state of the art in the industry.
