Um, and essentially I found this DevOps handbook, which has really not written as a textbook, but it's, it covers it's, it's built around the three ways of DevOps. So the first way is the notion of flow. The second way is the notion of, um, feedback. And the third way is continual learning and experimentation.

So this book [DevOps Handbook] is very well done in this sense [...] it goes to the foundations of devops and gets to the different key ideas, right?

The lectures, um, for the first part it's okay. I think for, until the midterm to have just get essentially through the book.

The book has a lot of case study and examples like Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, uh, Netflix.","Take Gene Kim's book DevOps Handbook as a reference to prepare a DevOps class.

2,15,"The microservices tool is one of the tools I have been using with them. A device, an environment in which we put the students' solutions there and they can see more of the Continuous Integration part there.

These systems being made available and then with the creation of the DevOps tool from the IFRN cloud, the microservices system there, it was then possible for us to have this more practical view of the process as a whole. So, I have adopted it in all semesters, including, I have always asked students to work with this tool.

Having this system already in the air, I also believe that it is another gain, why? Because as you advance in the themes, you can already put look, this aspect here that we are working on, you will have already contemplated in the system through this, this and this.","Use of a learning tool to facilitate understanding of the concept of Continuous Integration.

4,37,"So, suppose someone had a more traumatic experience at such a stage of the delivery process. In that case, you know how to use it at the right time with them and impersonate with them, talk, look, as you told me in that part, a solution that might work for you, again, because there is no ready-made solution, it would be to apply this technology to try to mitigate or resolve it.

I prefer to take it out during class to show the day-to-day blocks delivered in the end. However, the recommendation is to use the infrastructure blocks to feed your course, as didactics. Do you speak, look, remember the block we had? The dependency, the software is made in Java 8, and we tried to compile a machine that had Java 15. Do you see this problem? How do we solve it?

8,41,"The only way to teach culture, the only way to experience culture is to immerse the students in the culture. [...] one of the examples I give to my students is I say, you know, I took three years of Spanish in high school and I don't speak a word of Spanish, but I bet if I spent a summer in Spain, I would come back speaking, fluent Spanish. So I tell them: this class is your summer in Spain, right? We are going to live DevOps. We're going to experience DevOps. And that's the only way you can properly teach it.

4,46,"To put your hand on something, at least once every, depends a lot [...] on the schedule, but every, I'll put it every eight hours is a very subjective metric, but if you give something practical every eight hours with examples for the student to interact, so you don't stay in a lecture for hours on end talking, it's essential to know how to divide and balance.

He has up to twenty, twenty-five minutes, he has your attention. So, if you cannot break that, alternate the tone of voice you speak, interact with him. If you just talk, you quickly lose the student after twenty minutes.

We need to adapt to the environment and try, every twenty to thirty minutes, to interact with the student so that he does something to keep his attention [...] Always propose challenges.","Use practical examples regularly for the student to interact.

Interact with the student and break the tone of voice every 20 minutes, inhibiting their loss of attention.

Interact with the student to keep him alert, proposing challenges, for example."
4,48,"So, I think it's essential for you to break both the tone of voice, the didactics you're using, put examples, you'll explain something theoretical, like Lean, for example, does an exercise that simulates the Lean process, not in software, it can even be with software, it can be with blocks, use Trello, interact with the student because if you spend more than twenty minutes talking, anyway, any situation, even in a typical lecture, you lose the student, you lose the audience.","Use examples with students to teach theory.

Gist does not allow it.
4,62,"So, I usually recommend it to instructors; I recommend it to students when they share it with me. Decrease the FPF rate of screen sharing because that's a lock. Zoom uses what it can if you don't limit it. So, we restrict ten FPS, for example, so that I don't consume too much of my or the student's CPU because I sometimes have to correct the exercise on his side.","Limit the zoom FPS rate to 10, avoiding excessive student and instructor resource consumption."
4,63,"It would help if you observed each student and, and then, you have to listen a lot, too, what was the difficulty he had and where he arrived. So, then, we do a final assessment per student, but our perception of it. If he did well, if he had a lot of doubt, what was the point that generated the most suspicion for him?

I tell them, I am not going to grade you on what you submit. I'm going to grade you on how you got there because getting there is not the point. It's the journey, right? That's the point. [...] I teach them that every failure is a learning opportunity. If you fail and you learn something, you get credit. It's not a failure because you've learned something, we're here to learn.","Individually assess the student's progress throughout the course.

Grade students based on their learning journey and mistakes, not on what they submit. What's important is how they get there, because every failure is learning opportunity."
8,63,"You can't just grade what they submit. You have to watch how they're working.

For the assessment, as I said, I give them a lot of leeway in the beginning. Um, they can make mistakes on their Kanban board and still get full credit if they know what the mistakes are that they made. However, in later sprints, if they make the same mistakes, then I start taking points off.  So I give them time to learn, uh, so that they feel that they can make a few mistakes, take a few risks, um, and not get penalized for it.","Grade based how the students working their tasks and not only what they are submitting.

And so I bring that to the table and I think that provides a little less pressure on students.

I tend not to get quite as hyper-focused on right versus wrong answers. ... so treating it as, as more of an assessment of maybe architecture, if you will, or an assessment of approach, as opposed to this is right, this is wrong.

When people come in to do this, this, this feedback with the students, understand, the students also talk to a person who is not me, who on the last day, I leave, it is a recommendation I give, I leave the conference to leave the students at ease, talking to this person, they make a mistake during the training and the person got annoyed, and with you inside, they will be a little, a little afraid to expose, although it is also by email.","Evaluate the course, performing an NPS (Net Promoter Score) with students.

As much as we don't deliver it, the student creates a recipe in his head, and it won't fit in all of his daily routines. Then it will generate frustration. So, make it clear, look, can you see what we're doing? We're doing it for that reason, at Jenkins. Today we are going to use Bitbucket, for example, which is how we do it. One, as an example, correct?",Show the student that there are several ways and tools to do the task.

10,160,"we cannot make assumption on what they know. So we're trying to work without any assumption.
",Do not make assumption about the learning level of the students when you have students with different levels.
10,161,We show them Kubernetes.,Kubernetes can be chosen as DevOps tool.
14,161,"Let's go for something that we have more control on, uh, using for tools like Jenkins and and a stuff like Docker or Kubernetes was kind of good in a way to, uh, support the deployment and the, uh, like the building plus deployment stuff.

I want to be able to deploy it with containers. So it can be, um, through Kubernetes, it can be through Docker.","Use tools like Kubernetes to have more control on support the deployment.

Uses Kubernetes as container deployment tool adopted by the course."
11,162,"I covered it is a few lectures, like on, on DevOps and, um, which look at DevOps from a kind of generic perspective, like introducing the concept of DevOps and the challenges related to DevOps and, and, and so on. And then introducing them some of the basic tools, like for instance, so using things like continuous integration tools, like Jenkins SIM swollen. And, uh, so I tried to introduce, uh, between maybe spending about a couple of weeks doing that, like the course was about 12 weeks. And so in Zen App there, I focus more on specialized issues. So we spent some time on performance and scalability testing and things like the good testing and so on.","Start with a generic perspective of DevOps, basic concepts, and after a few weeks start to focus on specialized issues."
11,163,"what I do is that after introducing a concept and so on, I started really looking at very specific issues ... so in the lab we students learn, uh, in our, to be able to, for instance, to create a pipeline currency, DevOps pipeline, and, and, um, very, uh, set up A B tests, create test cases and do automated test, uh, test automation.","Introduce a concept and do labs with creating DevOps pipeline, setup A/B tests, and automated tests."
11,164,"The students have to do in the projects is to start by coming up with the requirements of the obvious application, and then start setting up their own environment and provide some additional functionalities that we want to implement.",Students start setting up their own DevOps environment and provide additional feature using simple application in the project.
12,164," So they have set up their environment.

The second one is to, we give them an application. It's an actually an HVAC humidity, air conditioning and ventilation, um, and they don't develop the application, but they have to build the pipeline to support this existing application.","Let students setup their environment for themselves.

Give students an application that they have to build the pipeline to support it."
11,165,"Also making the project interesting is important because it, you can, it's very easy when you are teaching to just take a very small project, which is not very, uh, challenging in all with students.
",The project of the class should not be very small and must be challenging.
11,166,for exam can be to use an open source application that we can use,For exam can be to use an open source application that we can use.
11,167,we use also SonarQube to help us on the automation,Use SonarQube to help on the automation.
11,168,for performance testing we use JMeter,Use JMeter for performance testing.
11,169,"we also security platform like, uh, Zap",Use OWASP Zap as security platform.
11,170,"So in terms of the tools, I feel better. I think one of the good aspect in DevOps is that there are a lot of tools [...] DevOps tools are available and where a lot of them are free and some of them are conscious of those. So a lot of them are free. And, and then, so, so far, I think it has been good.",There are many free DevOps tools available.
11,171,"Quite often, what we do is have someone in our team to implement the application.",Someone from teacher staff implements the sample application.
11,172,"So in the course I split, but so about 80% of presentation is just a regular, uh, concepts and so on and about 20% is about concrete applications.

 And so if we can find a way to be able to, to compress the experience or expertise in the practical experience and expertise in the context of lectures and so on.","Divide the course into 80% of concepts and 20% of applications.

Conciliate the experience in labs and the context of lectures."
11,173,"We presented as a lab project [...] So the students start initially by defining the requirements and then after they start a secondary pipeline, and then they do at least a couple of weeks iterations cycle and develop cycle. And then after they go to do performance testing to do a security testing and all those kinds of things, and for each of these deliverables, we submit something, every report. And, and, uh, so that's very easy to map because it's a very practical.","We presented as a lab project with five deliverables. The students start by defining the requirements and then after they start a secondary pipeline, and then they do at least a couple of weeks iterations cycle and develop cycle. And then after they go to do performance testing to do a security testing, and for each of these deliverables, we submit something, every report."
12,175,"I had a different assistant for the labs who was the next student. So the first time, and the labs were quite well received.

If you have lab assistants that are, you know, good, it's pretty easy to manage.","Qualified teacher assistant is important to setup the labs.

It is good to have teacher assistants with labs."
12,176,"the unicorn [project book] who was just, just published last year is more about the Dev stuff, but it really brings it into the mindset of, of, okay, what are the issues concretely that we face.",The Unicorn project book is a novel which covers the Dev side issues of DevOps.
12,177,"The Phoenix project ...  it's written also by essentially Jean Kim ... , it's written as a novel ... you get into the, the life of people that are facing issues that's are essentially DevOps issues ... he Phoenix project is more about the Ops side of things.",The Phoenix book by Jean Kim is a novel that covers the Ops side of DevOps.
12,178,"I need very solid, uh, research. It's a sorry, a lab assistance. The people responsible for the labs of course, assistants that that can actually deal with the students. So I'm lucky to have students and have good industrial experience, uh, to do that.",The teacher assistants need to be very qualified.
12,179,"So I chose, um, tuleap, which is an open source that was missing in mainly DevOps in France.",Use Tuleap for lifecycle management.
12,180,We try to make it minimal,Try to make the environment setup minimal.
12,181,"initially we were relying the, uh, admin, uh, personnel in our department, not admin, sorry, the, the engineering, uh, the, yeah, the, the infrastructure, the people that are responsible for the labs and so on. And now, since all of the students have their laptop, we try to make it as industrial as possible in lightweight as possible. So we don't need any internal support. [...] You just need this use to create their, uh, GitHub accounts. And, uh, you have to register to be able to get some AWS, uh, credits so that you can share with the students, but it's quite, it's quite easy.",You do not need to worry about university infrastruture when the students have Github and AWS accounts and you make the environment as industrial as lightweight as possible in all of the students laptops.
12,183,"First define the objectives of your course and making sure you stick to it.

But with respect to the technologies, I think that knowledge is, will change [...] I think like one of the, uh, not too good to give it giving advices or, but I can share my experience and my thoughts. Um, I think that that's important to remember one thing as important as what is the objectives of your course. ","Define clearly the objectives of your course and make sure you stick to it.

Constantly remember the students about the objective of the course."
13,183,"I think if we lay the rooms, uh, maybe it's more clearly and more specifically, I think students, we know better what they will get from what they do. [...]
I think we will have, uh, we will, um, uh, rewrite some of the rules to make sure that, uh, students know how many points they get for what they do, uh, beforehand we should do it because, uh, it will not be perfect because students can choose many different things.",Make sure the students know the rules of the course. For example how many points they get for what they do.
12,184,"I give them two case studies, uh, so to see if they can analyze a given situation.",Give case studies to see if the students can analyze a given situation in the exams.
14,184,"Like theoretical exam point of view, we use the case studies. ... you have three hours explain what you do in this situation. ...  we were really grading half of the description and half of the justification.

He grade scale was half description, half justification, and that's helped a lot, but it's always, um, qualitative in this way.","We use the case studies in theoretical exam. Students have three hours to explain what they do in this situation. We were really grading half of the description and half of the justification.

It is helpful to use the description and the justification of case studies on qualitative grade scale."
12,185,"we use one of the topics in DevOps that becomes quite important is value stream mapping. So to be able to capture your process is pretty simple in terms of modeling as a flow of activities, value stream mapping is a technique that has been used for quite a long time and in production.",Be able to capture your DevOps process in terms of modeling as a flow of activities using value stream mapping technique.
12,186,"it's not an analysis course, but I tried to bring it back regularly and say, okay, if you want to improve a process, whether you do so, it's one of the, one of the section in the book. And so it's okay. [...] you go from there to identify the, the points that could be improved, right. And then how do you want to improve it, then the techniques that are described in the book?",constantly try to figure out how to improve the quality of the course
12,187,"I'm thinking of bringing a couple of, um, industrial speakers as well to share their experience.",Try to bring industrial speakers to share their experience.
13,187,"We can have people, uh, there, there are, uh, there are everywhere that we can invite and, uh, let the students know what is going on in practice, not just some, uh, theoretical, uh, problem.

The lectures were not, uh, were not presented by the teachers. They were presented by the people who are, who were from the industry and invited to the, uh, to the course to present something for students.","Invite people to show students what's going on in practice, not only in theoretical problems.

The lectures could be presented by people who were from the industry."
14,187,"I think the course we've built in France was successful because we've done it with a software architect from IBM or the guy who was building, um, like as part of his industrial practice, he was building huge, uh, systems.

You need to have people interacting with the students that are practitioners and that really, uh, well know their in a way.

So we thought we were doing right, but after having discussed with industrial partners and practitioners, like not just discussed, you know, conference or attending a meetup, like really discussing for hours.

To carefully select the, um, I, I have a lot of industrial, uh, practitioners, guest lectures. Uh, we, we, we had the one prof that wasn't industrial.

The bigger mistake I've made was to, uh, use a coach. Uh, and we invited him and the guy was, uh, setting himself running himself as a DevOps coach, but the guy just had written books and, uh, had no idea what he was talking about.","It is important to have industrial partnership to share skills to contribute to the course.

You need to have DevOps practitioners interacting with the students.

Discuss the course with industrial partners and practitioners.

You should be careful about selecting guest lectures. Prefer industrial practitioners.

Do not invite a DevOps coach to do DevOps lectures."
12,188,"So that, I think it's one of our job to, to, to communicate with the student that it's not about the buzzword, this is something extremely serious.","It's important to communicate with students that DevOps is not buzzword, it is extremely serious."
13,189,"Then do, um, do some research about it, write an essay or, uh, or if there is, um, there is a tool available, uh, on GitHub it's, if it's open source, they can contribute to that, uh, to that tool and maybe fix some issues and report it to the teachers.

Many of them did was to engage in the, uh, in the development process of the, uh, of the large projects that other people are working on. And, uh, they could choose a project, I think with more than a hundred stars. ...  And they had to make sure that they pass all the, uh, all the steps and they had to do some contributions, but to there, to those for repositories. And, uh, and they had to also engage in a conversation with other people from other teams, uh, in the process that, uh, they were, uh, making those contributions.

They could contribute to some open source projects that are large projects and they are being used. So it's something that I'm looking for. Something we had some stats, uh, on github.","Do some research about DevOps topic, write an essay, and if the tool is open source, contribute to that tool and fix some issues and report it to the teachers.

The students should contribute and engage in the development process of the large projects with more than a hundred stars on Github.

Students could contribute to some open source projects that are large and being used and had more than one hundred stars."
13,190,"So, uh, we didn't have some predefined, uh, projects, and as we can, yes, this was a bigger problem for us.",Predefined project is important for the organization of the course.
13,191,"In fact, some of them, we asked them to, um, to, if they wanted to do a tutorial on a tool, we ask them to upload that tutorial on, uh, Katacoda.

So we asked the students, uh, to, uh, use another tool if they want to present something that doesn't work on katacoda. So, uh, the way that we solved it was to change the requirements and to change the, uh, change the environment and the tools that they had to use.

So that's the course automation and executable tutorial was, uh, chatter, katacoda, um, website. They use the katacoda that website to, uh, to write a tutorial on a tool for them DevOps.","Use the Katacoda website to students create tutorials about tools.

Change the requirements and the tools to solve the issues in environment setup on Katacoda.

The students write a tutorial about a DevOps tool on katacoda to describe the course automation."
13,192,"And they had to also engage in a conversation with other people from other teams, uh, in the process that, uh, they were, uh, making those contributions.

Other task that we ask them to do something for our own course, and, uh, then, uh, engage in a conversation with TAs and other students to make sure everything's more work well.
","Make students engage with people from other teams in the classes.

Engage in a conversation with teacher assistants and other students to make sure everything's more work well."
13,193,"if it was up to me, I would put some time to laying the background. And I'm talking about basics of DevOps and basics of some tools that are mainly used by everyone.",Teacher assistants help students with basics of DevOps concepts and tools.
13,194,"I think the time that we had was actually enough, it was, I think about two months ... Students had, uh, four hours in each week and they had to work on the projects, um, as well.  ...  they had some information, some background about software engineering.",Two months with four hours in each week is enough to students with some background about software engineering.
14,195,"So I had to find one that was dying and, uh, hopefully the colleague who was handling his dying course forgot to answer to an email.",Look for a dying course to include a DevOps one in the curriculum.
14,196,"So it's constantly discussing and constantly sharing in an open way, uh, what's happening, how it's teach, uh, how it's story telling and how, how things are going.",Constantly discuss and share the DevOps teaching in an open way.
14,197,So this guy was really half time IBM and half time in the faculty of engineering.,Teachers could be half time industrial and half time faculty.
