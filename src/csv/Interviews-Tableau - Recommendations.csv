And trying to change that mindset to emphasize more the idea of devops as a means of continuous improvement, as a means of organizational change. As a, to some extent I use this phrase guardedly, but to some extent, a philosophy around how the organization is going to go from concept to implementation, that's a much harder set of skills to pick up.

The global approach made sure the students not associated with devops with a CI/CD pipeline, because in my opinion, it's all about continuous improvement.

This mindset of thinking of continuous improvement is so important, right?  ... the improvement of the daily work is more important than the work itself.

What should I improve to make my process more efficient? So to me, this is the most important thing of DevOps. And, and, and then you do it through automation, automation of, of the deployment process, automation of, of, you know, the testing process automation later of the security, uh, thing and so on. Make clear the importance of the DevOps mindset like continuous improvement in constrast to using the tools.

Continuous improvement is a key DevOps concept.
